         My journey into coding began a few years ago when I discovered Codecademy, which quickly turned programming into one of my main hobbies. I’ve always been curious about how the software I used daily was built, and learning to code helped me explore that world. This interest led me to pursue an IT course in college with the aim of studying software engineering at university. However, as I approached my final year, I decided to take a more practical route by starting an apprenticeship, which eventually led me to the General Assembly bootcamp.

The bootcamp played a key role in helping me build the technical and professional skills needed to turn my passion for coding into a career. I’m now seeking a Junior Developer role where I can contribute to meaningful projects, collaborate with like-minded individuals, and continue growing as a developer.
