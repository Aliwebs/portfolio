          About Me
        </h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
          I got into coding after I discovered Codecademya few years ago, which quickly resulted in programming becoming
          a
          hobby.
          It was interesting for me because I was always curious how the software I used in my daily life worked and was
          made. I
          eventually chose to do an IT course at college as I was interested in doing software engineering at
          university.
          As
          I was
          about to do my last year I made the decision to do an apprenticeship, as I wanted something more practical
          which
          eventually
          led me to the GA bootcamp. The bootcamp greatly helped me in gaining skills that I needed to convert my
          coding hobby into a
          career. I am now looking for a role as a Junior Developer where I can connect with like minded people and grow
          my
          skills.
